<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

Two Paragraphs -- 

The first paragraph is about why we need a system for OSS intake. Reasons are that developers go to the Internet to procure software. As a result they bring that software into the organization. In doing so, they are bringing in published vulnerabilities and licences to which the organization must attend. 

The second paragraph is about the pragmatic working of the system --> really an overview of the DFD -- which you've done. 



The Dataflow Diagram for the company is for the storage of the licenses that the company holds as well as the
steps and processes to change the license information as well as delete the results of checking to see if they
have a license for a project. Changes that would result in deletion would come from management if given 
permission from ownership to make the changes. Developers can ask for information or changes to be made, but 
cannot change the information by themselves.The potential open source communities that would support this project 
would be Linux. Linux provides an operating system for servers that is used by many companies including some large 
corporations.
